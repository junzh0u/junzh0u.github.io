Hi there.

This is Jun Zhou.

I code, both [for living](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junzh0u) and [for fun](https://github.com/junzh0u).

In my spare time, I [do some woodworking](https://www.notion.so/junz/8242c68c9d2b4370a5b3fa013971fdef?v=d4acac668c1f472fbe16b996cea94ef8) and [play LEGO](https://rebrickable.com/users/junz/lego/).

If you'd like to chat, you can find me [on Telegram](https://t.me/junzh0u) or [via Email](mailto:junz@junz.info).
